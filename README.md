# django-blog
- This repository is about my Django blog on Heroku. Check out my [Django blog](https://www.myawsdjapp.com/).
- This project is inspired by [Corey M Schafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer)'s [Django Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p). I added and subtracted some features to fit my taste. 
- In this repository, you won't find any *settings.py* for local development, since I created a separate *local_settings.py* for that. Instead, you can see how my *prod_settings.py* is configured for production settings.
- I used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for deployment.
- This project is still under development. Any suggestion would be very much appreciated.
